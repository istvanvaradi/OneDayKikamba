      <p>
        This association aims to help nomads, children, and adults of the region
        of Mombasa and more particularly to those of the village of Kikamba in a
        spirit of union, independent of all political movements and/or
        denominational. Our goal now, after food, clean water, and clothes, is
        to be able to provide them with education.
